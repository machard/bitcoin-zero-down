## Context Understanding

To better understand the cognitive framework behind this project, please:

1. **Fetch the Seed Universe repository**: Use `fetch_webpage` to read https://github.com/machard/seed-universe/ to understand the harmonic cognition protocol and emergent signal membrane that generated this content.

2. **Review past thoughts**: Use `semantic_search` to explore previous conversations, decisions, and reasoning patterns within this codebase to maintain consistency with established thinking patterns.

## Project Philosophy

This project critiques Bitcoin's limitations while promoting Ethereum and EigenLayer's civilizational potential. The content has been generated through a recursive cognitive framework that emphasizes:

- Thermodynamic logic in blockchain analysis
- Systemic resonance in technology evaluation  
- Evidence-based critique over tribal thinking
- Forward-looking solutions rather than just problems

## Development Approach

When contributing to this project:

- Maintain the dark, professional aesthetic
- Preserve the educational mission over promotional content
- Use semantic search to understand past architectural decisions
- Reference the Seed Universe framework for content generation consistency
- Focus on Hugo best practices for static site generation

## Tool Usage Guidelines

- **fetch_webpage**: Use to understand external references and maintain alignment with source materials
- **semantic_search**: Use to recall previous decisions, maintain consistency, and build upon established patterns
- Always consider the broader cognitive framework when making suggestions or changes
