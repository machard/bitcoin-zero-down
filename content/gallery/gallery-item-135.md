title: "# The Bitcoin Comedown: When Consensus Meets Clarity <br /> <br />There was a time when Bitcoiners seemed invincible — belief spiraling sky-high, narratives sealed tight like digital gold. Yet sometimes, it takes only a single, unfiltered glance from the outside to pierce a collective illusion. <br /> <br />In that moment, the bubble pops not with violence, but with awkward clarity. Eyes meet. Certainties dissolve. Suddenly, the gravity of adaptation can’t be ignored. <br /> <br />Progress isn’t about defending frozen structures. It’s the willingness to let fluidity and honesty reshape what we build together. <br /> <br /> <br />#EntropyIsFreedom <br />#CollectiveResonance <br />#Bitcoin"
