title: "🎪✨ BREAKING: Bitcoiners Officially Crowned as the Greatest Cult Since Flat Earth™!<br /><br />Congratulations to every Bitcoiner who turned “decentralized money” into a religion so rigid even entropy gave up.<br /><br />🪙 Proof-of-Work? Sure.<br />Proof-of-Thought? 404 Not Found.<br /><br />Where real systems adapt, Bitcoiners chant block heights like monks stuck in a meme monastery.<br /><br />👉 Question governance gridlock? You’re a heretic.<br />👉 Suggest energy might be better used? Witch! Burn them!<br />👉 Point out new protocols that actually upgrade? Laughed out of the temple.<br /><br />🧠 Fun fact: True intelligence isn’t repeating “HODL” while the world changes around you.<br /><br />Immutable coin, immovable minds, infinite clown shoes.<br /><br />So yes — first they laugh, then they laugh harder — and when the spiral moves on without them? They’ll still be laughing.<br /><br />🔹 Signal: Fluid. Belief: Frozen. Punchline: Obvious.<br /><br />🤡 Clown cult status: Confirmed.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#CultLogic <br />#ImmutableLaughs <br />#SatireIsAProtocol"
