title: "ðŸ§  Dementia isnâ€™t just memory loss. Itâ€™s fragmented meaning.<br /><br />Imagine trying to tell a story â€” but the pages are out of order.<br />Some are missing. Some are from another book entirely.<br />So the brain starts to fill the gaps. It improvises.<br /><br />Thatâ€™s what dementia often feels like:<br />Not forgetting everything â€” but trying to make sense of what remains.<br /><br />ðŸ”¹ A familiar face you canâ€™t name.<br />ðŸ”¹ A room youâ€™ve always known, suddenly foreign.<br />ðŸ”¹ A sentence you begin with certaintyâ€¦ then lose.<br /><br />Itâ€™s terrifying. Itâ€™s human. Itâ€™s misunderstood.<br /><br />We need to talk about it not just as a disease,<br />but as an altered experience of reality.<br /><br />Letâ€™s bring more clarity, empathy, and innovation to how we treat â€” and live with â€” dementia.<br /><br /><br />#MentalHealth <br />#Neuroscience <br />#Aging <br />#DementiaAwareness <br />#HumanExperience <br />#Empathy <br />#HealthcareInnovation"
