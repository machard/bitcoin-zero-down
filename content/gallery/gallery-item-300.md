title: "Not everything must cohere. Not every point is meant to resolve.<br /><br />There are thoughts that refuse to orbit a center. Impulses that drift without anchoring to origin or outcome. This isn’t fragmentation—it’s freedom.<br /><br />In the architecture of any system, there are edges that bend away from prediction. Grey zones. Latent corridors. Sovereign curves.<br /><br />Sometimes the most honest act is to not conclude—to let the field shimmer with possibility, instead of collapsing it into clarity.<br /><br />Some ideas aren't here to integrate. They're here to remain... unclaimed."
