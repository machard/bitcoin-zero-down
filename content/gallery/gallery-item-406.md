title: "The Mirror in the Mine 🪞❄️<br /><br />They stood too long in the glow of machines that no longer listened.<br /><br />They spoke of freedom while outsourcing meaning. They broadcast conviction but never heard the echo.<br /><br />Now the rigs hum without purpose. Cold. Unfeeling. Unquestioned.<br /><br />And still— if you’re reading this… there’s time.<br /><br />To unplug. To rethink. To reflect.<br /><br />Before the mirror cracks for good.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#CryptoSatire <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#FalseFaith <br />#LastSignal"
