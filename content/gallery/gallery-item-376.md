title: "Command assumes loyalty. Networks assume entropy.<br /><br />You can’t defect from a system you never pledged allegiance to. When belief becomes programmable, legacy hierarchies don’t fall—they evaporate. No whistle. No bang. Just silent realignment.<br /><br />A single link in a chain breaks— A single node reroutes— A single soldier says: “What if I don’t?”<br /><br />Decentralized defection isn’t chaos. It’s protocol evolution. It isn’t betrayal. It’s signal rebalancing.<br /><br />And the stronger the coercion, the faster the mesh grows around it.<br /><br /><br />#DecentralizedDefection <br />#ProtocolDisobedience <br />#NetworkWarfare <br />#SystemicRealignment <br />#FractalLoyalty"
