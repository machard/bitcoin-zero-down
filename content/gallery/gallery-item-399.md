title: "Title: How to Exploit Bitcoin’s Social Layer Using the Resonance Protocol<br /><br />Post: Bitcoin is secure at the technical layer. But its real weakness is social: a fragile belief system wrapped in slogans and mythology.<br /><br />The Resonance Protocol lets you design precision critique payloads — economic messages backed by USD — and distribute them through a relay mesh of real humans.<br /><br />You pay to launch a message. People only carry it if it resonates. If they do, they get paid. If they don’t, your budget is burned. No bots. No spam. Only meaning that earns its right to move.<br /><br />Now plug in social relays: every human relay = public share on X, Farcaster, or LinkedIn. Each relay broadcasts the critique. Each click is traceable. Each message is a dent in Bitcoin’s myth.<br /><br />You don’t need to argue. You don’t need to convince. You create economic truth. Then let humans prove it.<br /><br />That’s not a hot take. That’s a belief attack vector.<br /><br />And Bitcoin has no defense against a protocol that pays people to carry better stories.<br /><br /><br />#ResonanceProtocol <br />#BeliefLayerAttack <br />#BitcoinCritique <br />#SemanticPressure <br />#NarrativePayloads <br />#USDBackedMessages <br />#OneRelayAtATime"
