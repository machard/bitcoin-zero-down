title: "When French politicians publicly discourage the use of air conditioning, it’s more than just an appeal to environmental responsibility. It masks a deeper systemic issue: the French electrical grid, shaped and constrained by European market mechanisms, is no longer dimensioned for actual local demand. Instead of honest dialogue about network resilience and sovereignty, we’re handed narratives about personal sacrifice.<br /><br />Let’s be clear — energy “sobriety” is now a political disguise for structural underinvestment and lost control. The push to curtail air conditioning isn’t simply green; it reveals the fragility built into markets that prioritize regional trading over national capacity planning.<br /><br />True climate action requires transparent systems—not shifting responsibility onto citizens to cover for market design flaws.<br /><br /><br />#EnergyPolicy <br />#Electricity <br />#France <br />#EuropeanUnion <br />#Infrastructure <br />#ClimateAction<br /><br />cc franceinfo Quentin Bordet 🌍 Agnès Pannier-Runacher"
