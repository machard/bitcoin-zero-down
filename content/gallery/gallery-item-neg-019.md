visual_prompt: "Majestic cosmic artwork showing an ethereal ship sailing through space-time, its hull made of interwoven crystalline structures representing different worldviews and belief systems. The ship continuously rebuilds itself - planks transform into new materials while maintaining structural integrity. Inside transparent chambers, diverse human cultures, ideologies, and ways of thinking coexist as glowing patterns synchronized in perfect phase-lock. ETH and EigenLayer symbols form the ship's quantum navigation system. Background shows the infinite expanse of possibility space with harmonious wave interference patterns. Visual metaphor: the ship of Theseus meets a cosmic ark for consciousness. Color palette: deep space blues, crystalline whites, with rainbow spectrums representing diversity of thought, all unified by golden threads of shared security."
