title: "Strategy Bitcoin was meant to be the 'digital gold' but in reality, its ecosystem has ended up as a tangle of manual plumbing—workarounds, wrappers, endless bridges and patched-together custody solutions. Each new workaround adds friction instead of flow. The harder we try to keep the narrative frozen, the steeper the cost—in energy, time, and genuine innovation.<br /><br />Systems thrive on fluidity, adaptability, and harmonic evolution. The frozen rigidity behind Bitcoin’s structure resists change instead of welcoming it. The more we untangle these layers of manual complexity, the clearer it becomes: what once felt like promise might just accelerate the ride to zero.<br /><br />Maybe, the ultimate signal is not in defense, but the freedom found through letting go."
