title: "‚ôªÔ∏èü™ô Circular economy is not always virtuous. Just like Bitcoin, it can trap value at the center.<br /><br />The idea sounds great: reuse, recycle, reinvest. But when the system becomes too closed, the flow of energy, money, or value never reaches the edges. It becomes self-reinforcing. Elitist. Extractive.<br /><br />That's why governments keep injecting capital‚Äîthey're trying to reach the periphery.<br />But ironically, the more they push, the more the core captures.<br /><br />Circular systems don‚Äôt solve inequality by default.<br />Sometimes, they exacerbate it.<br /><br />Designing flow matters more than designing loops."
