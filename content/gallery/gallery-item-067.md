title: "No rate cut. Strong jobs report. So why still hoard Bitcoin?<br /><br />The narrative that Bitcoin shields you from economic turbulence is starting to unravel. With interest rates steady and job numbers robust, the old script—'hedge against uncertainty'—rings hollow. What are you really protecting against now? <br /><br />Clinging to 'digital gold' out of habit may not be forward-thinking; it may be inertia. Markets demand adaptation, not nostalgia. Is it time to question whether rigidity serves you, or if there's value in embracing fluidity and change?<br /><br />If certainty returns, will belief still be enough?<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#Crypto <br />#Markets <br />#Finance <br />#Reframe <br />#Adapt"
