title: "🌀 Micromanipulation isn’t loud—it’s calibrated.<br /><br />A well-placed pang of guilt here, a subtle “Why are you like this?” there.<br /><br />These aren't expressions—they're directional cues. She’s not trying to change you.<br /><br />She’s re-routing your mental map until you choose the path she already sketched.<br /><br />And you’ll swear it was your idea."
