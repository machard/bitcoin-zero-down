title: "The Ledger Halo 🔗🪞🧠<br /><br />It doesn’t lie. It can’t be changed. It must be truth. Right?<br /><br />The ledger glows. Unedited. Immutable. A monument to precision.<br /><br />But permanence is not wisdom. And timestamped data is not discernment.<br /><br />When they stop thinking because “it’s on-chain”… they’ve mistaken record for reality.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#LedgerHalo <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire"
