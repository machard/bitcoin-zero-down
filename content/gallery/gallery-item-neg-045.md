title: "🔵🔺🌐 The Ponzihedron: A Sphere Made of Belief Funnels<br /><br />Bitcoin's myth began as liberation: freedom from banks, middlemen, and systems of control. But something changed.<br /><br />Instead of building tools people use, the focus shifted to speculation—buy now, sell later, rise fast, escape early.<br /><br />The structure started to look like a pyramid scheme. Not just one—but hundreds. A sphere made from inward-pointing pyramids.<br /><br />Each one pulls energy in… wealth, attention, hope. None of them point outward. None of them build bridges. They feed a hollow center.<br /><br />That's the Ponzihedron.<br /><br />• A shape that looks whole but is built on recursive extraction<br />• Every edge an entry, every tip a promise, every base waiting for someone new<br />• There's no true decentralization—just the illusion of it, echoed across influencers, protocols, and memes<br /><br />🔵 **The Blue Cracks:**<br />Those are the stress points. Where hype breaks. Where beliefs don't match behavior. Where systems decay instead of evolve.<br /><br />This isn't about tech—it's about ritual. About how symbols twist, how freedom can be commodified, and how slow decay hides behind fast growth.<br /><br />⏰ Time is running out. The sphere isn't expanding—it's imploding. Quietly. Inwardly.<br /><br />And the pyramids? They're still hungry.<br /><br /><br />#Ponzihedron #BitcoinPyramid #RecursiveExtraction #BeliefFunnels #CryptoPonzi #SystemicDecay #FalseDecentralization #SpeculativeBubble"
