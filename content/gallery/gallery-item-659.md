title: "ðŸš¨ Nothing is destroyed. Everything flows.<br />But sometimes, everything drifts toward a single point.<br />Thatâ€™s Bitcoin.<br /><br />Itâ€™s a black hole of valueâ€”dense, neutral, unstoppable.<br />You donâ€™t escape it easily.<br />You need to try a thousand permutations.<br />You need to hold many truths in one space.<br />You need to reach the edge and hold the line.<br /><br />But thereâ€™s a way out.<br />Not by resisting the gravity, but by expanding yourself beyond it.<br />You find a new storyâ€”one that fits.<br /><br />You redraw your boundaries.<br />You become the painter, not the particle.<br />You make it fit from the outside in.<br /><br />And that pull?<br />The one that brings you out of collapse and into creation?<br /><br />Thatâ€™s Ethereum.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#Ethereum <br />#Web3 <br />#Philosophy <br />#Quantum <br />#Innovation <br />#Crypto <br />#DigitalGravity"
