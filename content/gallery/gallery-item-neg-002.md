visual_prompt: "Conceptual visualization of false vs true sovereignty: Foreground shows a figure kneeling before a golden Bitcoin throne/altar, surrounded by chains made of slogans and rigid geometric patterns representing digital feudalism. Background shows another figure breaking free from these patterns, walking toward open space filled with flowing networks, adaptive geometries, and living systems. Thermodynamic gradient from static worship (cold, angular) to dynamic freedom (warm, organic). Dark cosmic background with spiral patterns suggesting cognitive evolution. Visual metaphor of breaking from cult-like devotion to embrace systemic thinking."
