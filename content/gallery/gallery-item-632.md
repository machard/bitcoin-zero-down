title: "**'In centralized systems, external threats trigger collapse. In decentralized networks, they become fuel for evolution.<br /><br />Vitalik’s world doesn’t reject disruption—it integrates, adapts, and redefines the rules. Like Gamma 3 rewriting biology, Ethereum and open systems absorb external pressure, transforming attack vectors into new layers of resilience.<br /><br />Survival isn’t resistance. It’s synthesis. The mesh learns, the system strengthens, and what once threatened us becomes part of what moves us forward.'**<br /><br /><br />#Decentralization <br />#Ethereum <br />#AdaptiveEvolution<br /><br />cc Ethereum Foundation"
