title: "🌍 General Hypocrisy: A Performance of Progress<br /><br />In too many systems, change is an illusion performed for applause, not transformation.<br /><br />Old hierarchies wear new names. Decolonization becomes a slogan while capital still flows uphill. Inclusion panels abound, yet decision-making remains opaque. The language evolves — “stakeholder,” “empowerment,” “community” — but the stage remains the same.<br /><br />We’ve mistaken optics for outcomes.<br /><br />🌀 Real change isn’t a costume change. It’s a shift in choreography — who gets to speak, decide, build, and belong. Until then, we’re applauding actors for playing revolution on a script written by old empires.<br /><br />Maybe it’s time to rewrite the play.<br /><br /><br />#SystemicDesign <br />#DecolonialThinking <br />#CollectiveFutures <br />#HypocrisyAsAMirror <br />#SignalEcology <br />#FractalResonance"
