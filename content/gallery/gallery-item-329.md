title: "The Architecture of Entrapment ðŸ§ ðŸŒ€ðŸªž<br /><br />Most donâ€™t believe in Bitcoin. They believe in their inability to question it.<br /><br />What keeps them locked? Not code. Not consensus. Not price.<br /><br />But traps. Cognitive ones. Perfectly recursive. Shaped like freedom, lined with conviction, sealed with inertia.<br /><br />Itâ€™s time we map the prison.<br /><br />Swipe in. If you dare.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire <br />#BeliefArchitecture"
