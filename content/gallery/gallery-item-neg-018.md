visual_prompt: "Educational wildlife scene showing BBC Dave with thick glasses squinting at two animals - a clever fox (representing sophisticated DeFi protocols) and a menacing wolf (representing predatory CeFi platforms). Dave points confused at both saying 'Same thing!' Above each animal are floating labels showing their true characteristics: Fox has 'Decentralized', 'Auditable', 'Composable' while Wolf has 'Centralized', 'Opaque', 'Predatory'. In the background, other forest creatures (representing experienced traders) are facepalming as Dave approaches the wolf thinking it's friendly. Visual metaphor: nature's warning signs that Dave completely misses. Color palette: forest greens and earth tones, with warning reds around the wolf that Dave ignores."
