title: "The Community Cage ðŸ«‚ðŸªžðŸ§ <br /><br />At first, it feels like home. Familiar voices. Inside jokes. Signal chats. Echoes of purpose.<br /><br />Then you try to ask. Try to think. Try to breathe.<br /><br />But the smiles tighten. The DMs go quiet. The likes stop flowing.<br /><br />Youâ€™re not being punished. Youâ€™re being forgotten.<br /><br />Not because you left the chain. But because you left the chant.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#CommunityCage <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire"
