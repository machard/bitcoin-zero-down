title: "ðŸŽ‰ Celebrating Bitcoin: The Most Beautifully Useless Digital Artifact Ever Created! ðŸŽ‰<br /><br />Bitcoin, you magnificent cryptographic bauble. Like a shimmering screen saver in the museum of human ambition, you have no obligation to utility. Your greatest resonance is in your refusal to changeâ€”pure, untouchable, gleaming in the void. <br /><br />You absorb energy, attention, and speculation as if they were the point itself. Art for artâ€™s sakeâ€”code for codeâ€™s sake. You remind us that sometimes the value of a thing lies in its spectacle, its permanence, its splendid inertia.<br /><br />Letâ€™s toast to Bitcoin, the digital snow globe we never needed but cannot stop gazing into. Useless? Perhaps. Joyful? Absolutely.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#DigitalArtifact <br />#JoyOfUselessness <br />#Spectacle <br />#ImmutableArt"
