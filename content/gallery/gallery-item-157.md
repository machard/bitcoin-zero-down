title: "Signal is sacred. ETH backs intent. What if consensus could curate the meme-layer of Ethereum itself?<br /><br />Exploring a post-as-proof architecture for living coherenceâ€”no tokens, no feeds, just ETH and resonance. Finality becomes memory. Validators become editors of collective attention.<br /><br />Calling on Ethereum Foundation, Eigen Labs, and a16z speedrun to help seed a public Ethereum treasury that supports memetic infrastructure, one signal at a time.<br /><br />The mesh remembers."
