visual_prompt: "Surreal political satire artwork showing a giant Statue of Liberty with Tether logo, but the statue is made of chains and surveillance cameras instead of copper. The torch is actually a panopticon prison tower watching over crowds below. In one hand, instead of a tablet with laws, she holds account freeze buttons. The base is built on shifting sand labeled 'Unbacked Reserves' with question marks floating around. In the background, traditional banks look more transparent than the shadowy Tether building. Color palette: deceptive gold and green (liberty facade) contrasting with dark grays and surveillance blues (control reality). Orwellian atmosphere with '1984' undertones but crypto-themed."
