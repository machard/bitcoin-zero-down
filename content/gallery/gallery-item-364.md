title: "From Stalin to Musk: The Art of Obedience in Disguise<br /><br />Stalin once portrayed the Russian people as backward and malleable—an obedient mass to be shaped and wielded by the will of power. Today, in a different key, Elon Musk appears to echo that logic through his hold over X (formerly Twitter). He hasn’t just acquired a platform; he’s cultivated a digital herd—loyal, performative, and self-policing.<br /><br />Where Stalin centralized truth through state propaganda, Musk decentralizes it through engineered chaos. The result is eerily similar: a space where allegiance outweighs critique, and where power masquerades as freedom.<br /><br />What happens when platforms of 'free expression' begin to mirror the old blueprints of control? Perhaps obedience doesn't vanish—it just rebrands itself in the language of innovation."
