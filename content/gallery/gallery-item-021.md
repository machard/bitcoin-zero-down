title: "Some people choose to be clogs in the system.<br /><br />Their entire role? Be annoying enough to matter — but not so annoying that they get replaced. They hold flow hostage, extracting ransom payments for not blocking the pipes too much.<br /><br />In the age of resonance, we see them clearly.<br />Gatekeepers. Bureaucrats. Obstructionists who thrive on friction.<br /><br />The real work? Removing these clogs. Designing systems where you don’t have to pay people to stay out of your way — where value flows clean, and incentives align with contribution, not inertia.<br /><br />Keep the pipes clear. Flow is freedom.<br /><br /><br />#SignalEcology <br />#SystemicDesign <br />#RemoveTheClogs <br />#Resonance <br />#Leadership"
