title: "🤡✨ BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — loves to debate you.<br /><br />But here’s the catch:<br /><br />👉 To talk with him, you first have to accept the conversation will make zero sense.<br />👉 He’ll loop slogans, flip arguments, contradict himself — and call that “winning.”<br />👉 His only consistency? Distraction.<br /><br />It’s not a conversation.<br />It’s a carnival of contradictions.<br /><br />Signal lost. Time wasted.<br /><br />🔹 Talk wisely. Some clowns just want the noise.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#BBC <br />#BigBitcoinClown <br />#Satire <br />#Noise <br />#EchoChamber"
