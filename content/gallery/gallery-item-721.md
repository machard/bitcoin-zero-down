title: "I didn’t switch sides. I just stayed curious.<br /><br />I started out respecting Proof of Work — the elegance, the resistance to change, the purity of it.<br /><br />But I watched PoS evolve.<br />I watched it open doors.<br />I watched it reward contribution instead of just capital.<br /><br />Now I’m not here to store value. I’m here to use it.<br />To build, participate, govern — not just hold and hope.<br /><br />This isn’t about tribalism. It’s about trajectory.<br /><br />PoW gave us the spark.<br />PoS is giving us a system that can scale, adapt, and include.<br /><br />And if you’re still holding out for ideological reasons — fine. But don’t pretend nothing’s changed.<br /><br />Because everything has.<br /><br /><br />#ProofOfStake <br />#CryptoPerspective <br />#OnchainBuilders <br />#Decentralization <br />#Web3Future"
