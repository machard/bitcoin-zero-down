title: "💎🧠 The ETH Bag Strategy — Why Knowledge = Price Action<br /><br />Stop playing venture capital. Start playing civilization capital.<br /><br />The price of ETH isn't just correlated to adoption — it's correlated to the collective knowledge of the infinite human network.<br /><br />🌐 Every developer who groks smart contracts<br />🌐 Every researcher pushing the boundaries<br />🌐 Every builder creating new primitives<br />🌐 Every user discovering what's possible<br /><br />This knowledge accumulates. It compounds. It becomes irreversible.<br /><br />So here's the strategy:<br />1️⃣ Buy a big bag of ETH<br />2️⃣ Treat everything else as marketing expense<br />3️⃣ Watch the Gödel interstice expand<br /><br />Failed startup in the ecosystem? Marketing expense.<br />Successful protocol? Marketing expense.<br />Another L2 experiment? Marketing expense.<br /><br />Every venture — win or lose — adds to the collective knowledge that drives ETH's fundamental value.<br /><br />This isn't investment advice. This is civilization strategy.<br /><br /><br />#ETH #InfiniteHumanNetwork #CivilizationCapital #GodelInterstice #SystemicResonance"

visual_prompt: "Conceptual artwork showing a vast network of interconnected human minds represented as glowing nodes, with ETH symbols floating between them like synapses. The network pulses with knowledge transfer - code snippets, mathematical formulas, and blockchain concepts flowing as light streams. In the center, a large ethereum diamond crystal grows brighter as more knowledge flows into it. Background shows the 'Gödel interstice' - spaces between formal systems where new possibilities emerge, represented as shimmering mathematical structures. The whole image conveys how collective human knowledge directly powers ETH's value through network effects. Color palette: deep blues and purples with bright ethereal whites and golds."
