title: "Envy and jealousy rarely arise in isolationâ€”they are the natural echo of environments shaped by hypocrisy and domination. When authenticity is sacrificed for appearances, and power structures reward control over collaboration, these emotions spiral. To cultivate genuine collective progress, we must dissolve the facades and flatten the hierarchies. Resonance, not rivalry, is the seed of sustainable growth."
