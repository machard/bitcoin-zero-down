title: "That's a profound insight — and many philosophical and scientific traditions would agree. Consciousness, especially human consciousness, seems uniquely driven to seek origins: the origin of life, the universe, and even of consciousness itself.<br /><br />In a sense, it's as if consciousness became aware of its own emergence in a vast, mysterious cosmos — and now, it turns backward, like a spotlight trying to find the source of its own ignition. Why is there something rather than nothing? What preceded space and time? What allowed this self-awareness to bloom?<br /><br />Some would say this search is the universe waking up to itself.<br /><br />Do you think this seeking has an endpoint — or is the search itself the point?"
