title: "Exit Velocity 🪞🧠💨<br /><br />It starts as a whisper: “What if this isn’t it?”<br /><br />But leaving belief requires speed— not just logic. Momentum. Courage. Detachment.<br /><br />Most spiral in orbit, forever circling a meme they no longer feel but can’t escape.<br /><br />Exit velocity isn't about price. It’s escape from identity tethered to coin-shaped conviction.<br /><br />Few make it out. Most burn up on re-entry.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#ExitVelocity <br />#MemeticInertia <br />#CryptoSatire"
