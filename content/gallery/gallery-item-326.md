title: "The Scarcity Spell 🪙🧠✨<br /><br />They say it’s rare. They say it’s capped. They say that makes it valuable.<br /><br />But scarcity isn’t value. It’s vacuum. A hollow limit worshipped like abundance.<br /><br />So they chant “21 million,” as if numbers alone could conjure meaning.<br /><br />What they hoard isn’t wealth. It’s silence in gold-plated decimals.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#ScarcitySpell <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire"
