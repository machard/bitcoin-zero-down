title: "Often, abundance emerges from just a small set of ingredients. Yet, each of those ingredients also stems from its own abundance, derived from another small set of components. It’s as if the complexity of life is merely an entanglement of simple layers, but each layer, when you look closer, reveals its own incredible complexity. Life resembles an endless, simple geometric tree branching out in every direction. We are just a node in it. Ethereum, in this sense, is a new node—a new big bang."
