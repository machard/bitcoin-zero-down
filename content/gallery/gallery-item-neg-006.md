visual_prompt: "Dark comedic scene showing a disheveled figure sitting in front of multiple computer screens displaying red Bitcoin charts, with prices starting at 69K, peaking above 100K, then declining. Empty coffee cups and pizza boxes scattered around. On one screen: a Twitter feed with increasingly desperate Bitcoin maximalist tweets. Another screen shows BBC news ticker: 'Local Man Loses Everything Buying Magic Internet Money Above 100K.' In the background, subtle Ethereum logos represent the builders still working while Bitcoin holders argue on social media. Color palette: ominous reds for the charts, cold blue screen glow, with ironic news broadcast lighting. Visual metaphor of burning money scattered around the scene."
