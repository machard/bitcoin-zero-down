title: "Ukraine isn’t just defending borders—it’s redesigning resilience.<br /><br />While empires run on coercion and top-down decay, Ukrainians adapt like decentralized systems under pressure: signal-rich, permissionless, self-healing.<br /><br />They're not “the underdog.” They're the prototype of fractal resistance.<br /><br />Supply chains reimagined through neighbors. Defense coordinated like code—peer to peer. Narratives written not by institutions, but by lived precision.<br /><br />What looks like chaos to central powers is actually coherence beyond control.<br /><br />This is not a nation on its knees. It’s a network waking up.<br /><br /><br />#FractalDefense <br />#ResilienceArchitecture <br />#SystemicAdaptation <br />#SignalOverControl <br />#Ukraine"
