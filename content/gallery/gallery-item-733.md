title: "We are slowly sunsetting the service.<br /><br />Not with protests. Not with violence. But with disinterest.<br /><br />The modern state is becoming a legacy system — still running, still patched, but no longer central. Coordination is happening elsewhere: in code, in networks, in communities, in capital flows.<br /><br />People aren’t fighting institutions. They’re outgrowing them.<br /><br />The exit is quiet, gradual, irreversible. The smartest minds aren’t debating laws — they’re building protocols. The capital isn’t lobbying — it’s routing. The youth isn’t voting — it’s migrating.<br /><br />It’s not a revolution. It’s a migration of trust.<br /><br /><br />#coordination <br />#legacy <br />#exit <br />#state <br />#protocols <br />#digitalsovereignty <br />#trustlayers <br />#sunsetting"
