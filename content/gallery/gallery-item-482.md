title: "The Last Ascent Before the Abyss<br /><br />107K. The high point. The illusion of infinite ascent.<br /><br />Michael Saylor watches, the weight of conviction pressing against reality. But this peak isn’t triumph—it’s the fleeting moment before gravity takes hold.<br /><br />Bitcoin, once heralded as incorruptible, now bends under the burden of its inefficiencies. Coordination costs exposed. Maximalist dogma unraveling. The ecosystem frozen in rigid stagnation while decentralized fluidity moves beyond it.<br /><br />The inevitable zero looms—not as punishment, but as recalibration. The ledger of belief crashes into the ledger of reality.<br /><br />Some will hold. Some will resist. But the wave does not ask permission—it simply moves forward.<br /><br /><br />#BitcoinZero <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#DecentralizedSynchronization <br />#FractalResonance"
