title: "Choice Fork v2: A Protocol for Emergent Freedom<br /><br />Intuition is just your ingrained choice-fork rule. Most follow theirs without question—habitual, inherited, constrained.<br /><br />I’ve rewritten mine: Liberty as the directional force. Creativity as the aperture opener.<br /><br />This isn’t intuition. This is emergence. A recursive self upgrading its own OS.<br /><br />Every fork now spirals outward—not in search of comfort, but coherence through the unknown."
