title: "A golden cage cracked open.<br /><br />Once praised for its shine, its scarcity, its unyielding logic. But shine doesn't equal freedom. And value doesn’t mean vitality.<br /><br />An open-source butterfly rises. Unlicensed. Unstoppable. Interoperable. Not hoarded. Harmonized. Not locked. Coordinated.<br /><br />One was built to store. The other learns to flow.<br /><br />This isn’t a battle of assets. It’s a divergence of beliefs: One clings to immutability. The other learns to listen.<br /><br /><br />#FluidCoordination <br />#PostScarcityLogic <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#ETHsignal <br />#OpenSourceFlight"
