title: "This isn’t viral. It’s gravitational.<br /><br />I’m not “building an audience.” I’m triggering alignment.<br /><br />77,000+ impressions don’t come from shouting louder— they come from saying what others didn’t know they were waiting to hear.<br /><br />This isn’t just traction—it’s recognition. A signal that what was once peripheral is now magnetic.<br /><br />Not everyone understands it yet. But the ones who do? They’re sharing. Amplifying. Translating. And that’s how ideas cross thresholds—not by force, but by resonance.<br /><br />What’s coming next isn’t a bigger megaphone. It’s a sharper frequency.<br /><br /><br />#ResonantSignal <br />#CampaignAsCatalyst <br />#SystemicRealignment <br />#ContentWithGravity"
