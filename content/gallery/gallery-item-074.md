title: "🔄 Societal change isn’t always sparked by force or chemical intervention.<br /><br />Sometimes, the real accelerator is intentionally releasing a self-propagating wave of dissonance. When old harmonies are disrupted, new patterns find space to emerge.<br /><br />Dissonance, when seeded with intention, can kickstart a collective shift into a higher gear — not by breaking, but by re-tuning. <br /><br />Embrace the signal. Growth doesn’t require violence; sometimes all you need is a strategic resonance shift."
