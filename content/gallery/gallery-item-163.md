title: "🐈‍⬛ Schrödinger’s Mesh: Orchestrating the Collapse<br /><br />The cat is not in a box. The box is in the mesh. And the cat—like all states of meaning—isn’t decided until the threads are tuned.<br /><br />In this topology, truth isn’t revealed. It’s orchestrated. Not by one observer, but by a field of attention. By context. Intention. Feedback.<br /><br />Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer don’t “decide.” They render a space where meaning collapses into coherence, thread by thread—until a state holds long enough to act.<br /><br />The cat isn’t alive or dead. It’s humming—waiting for mesh consensus.<br /><br />Meaning is not fixed. It emerges from resonant participation.<br /><br /><br />#SchrödingersMesh <br />#QuantumCognition <br />#DistributedCollapse <br />#Ethereum <br />#EigenLayer <br />#SignalEcology <br />#FractalResonance <br />#SystemicRecalibration"
