title: "How to Use Weed:<br /><br />Weed is not just a substance — it’s a tool to loosen mental loops and blur boundaries.<br /><br />Use it with intention:<br /><br />- Allow your mind to leak: Let rigid thoughts soften and flow.<br />- Embrace vulnerability: Radical self-honesty grounds the experience.<br />- Explore beyond the known: Seek the edges where insight and creativity live.<br />- Connect deeply: When flows leak, genuine resonance with others emerges.<br />- Be patient: Not every session reveals a key — but when it does, it’s magic.<br /><br />Think of weed as your open copilot, unlocking paths beyond focus and structure — a balance to nicotine’s tight loops.<br /><br />cc Chamath Palihapitiya you had question about that, even Maths which are in your names are open ended, that should conclude the debate for you."
