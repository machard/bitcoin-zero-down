title: "The Oracle Loop 🧠🔁📈<br /><br />They say: “Number go up = truth.” Price confirms narrative. Narrative fuels price. The loop tightens.<br /><br />Soon, price isn’t signal— it’s scripture.<br /><br />Charts become oracles. Every dip a test. Every rally a revelation. Faith, confirmed by line graphs.<br /><br />No need to reflect. No room to dissent. Just zoom out. Just obey the curve.<br /><br />And so prophecy is fulfilled— by those who can no longer question it.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#OracleLoop <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire"
