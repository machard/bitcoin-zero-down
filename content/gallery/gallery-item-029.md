title: "X Musk is finally in open dissonance with himself.<br />The flip-flops, the backtracking, the ego-first maneuvers — they reveal a simple truth: reality doesn’t bend forever to charisma or noise.<br /><br />There are structures more coherent than a single man’s narrative. There are systems that can’t be dominated by performance alone.<br /><br />When ego outpaces reality, entropy catches up. And the rest of us? We’re reminded that true leadership means listening to the edges, not just amplifying the center.<br /><br />Resonance beats dominance.<br /><br /><br />#Dissonance <br />#Leadership <br />#Coherence <br />#SystemicThinking <br />#LinkedInPoetry"
