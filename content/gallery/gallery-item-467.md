title: "Voltaire: The Spark That Ignited Revolutions<br /><br />A mind that refused to be shackled. A voice that dismantled illusions. Voltaire did not simply critique—he dissected power, exposing its contradictions with razor-sharp wit.<br /><br />Relentless in his pursuit of truth, he championed reason over dogma, freedom over tyranny, and thought over obedience. His words stirred upheaval, empowering generations to question, resist, and redefine their world.<br /><br />His legacy isn’t bound to history. It lives—wherever ideas clash against oppression, wherever minds refuse to conform.<br /><br />'Liberty, justice, and satire—the tools of those who dare to think.'<br /><br /><br />#Voltaire <br />#PhilosophyOfFreedom <br />#QuestionEverything <br />#RationalRevolution"
