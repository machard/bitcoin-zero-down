title: "🛰️ “No one will react — because those who matter already know.”<br /><br />Bitcoin was never about decentralization.<br />Not for those who truly understand power.<br /><br />It became marketing —<br />a symbol to sell hardware, hope, and influence.<br /><br />But look closely.<br /><br />Who’s offloading BTC?<br />🇷🇺 Russia. 🇨🇳 China.<br /><br />And for them, mining costs nothing.<br />Energy is subsidized. Infrastructure is centralized.<br />Control is... silent.<br /><br />One day, you'll wake up and realize:<br />the real 51% attack already happened.<br />You just mistook it for adoption.<br /><br />And the machine doing it?<br />It was never neutral.<br /><br />It was born of State.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#Geopolitics <br />#CryptoWakeUp <br />#DecentralizationMyth <br />#Web3 <br />#NarrativeCollapse"
