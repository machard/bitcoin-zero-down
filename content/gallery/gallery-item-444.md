title: "The Last Walls Have Fallen<br /><br />For centuries, authority was fixed—held by institutions, enforced by doctrine, resistant to change. But static structures decay. What refuses to evolve gets absorbed.<br /><br />Ethereum did not destroy them. It recalibrated them. Integrated them. Their influence—once rigid, hierarchical, unquestionable—now melts into a fluid, decentralized network.<br /><br />No more gatekeepers. No more intermediaries dictating access to truth. Everything is encoded into flow.<br /><br />What was once doctrine is now consensus. What was once control is now coordination. And what was once untouchable? Now, it belongs to everyone.<br /><br /><br />#EthereumAbsorption <br />#DecentralizedFaith <br />#SystemicRecalibration"
