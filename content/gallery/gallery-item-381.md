title: "The energy transition won’t be centralized.<br /><br />It will emerge node by node— each transformer owning its scale, each flow aligned not by command, but by principle: no leakage.<br /><br />Stop waiting for unified plans. Start respecting distributed precision. This isn’t chaos. It’s choreography.<br /><br />The new grid isn’t a pyramid. It’s a constellation.<br /><br /><br />#FractalTransition <br />#EnergyAutonomy <br />#SystemicIntegrity <br />#NoLeakage <br />#RecalibrationInProgress<br /><br /><br />#HabibiSaitTOUT"
