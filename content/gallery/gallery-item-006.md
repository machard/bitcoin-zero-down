title: "🏰🤡 BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — finally made it to the fabled MAGA Citadel.<br /><br />Inside, he’s chomping on stale Bitcoin coins like they’re golden communion wafers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, across the moat, the Carrot Standard Citadel is humming — fertile gardens, shared signal, living governance.<br /><br />BBC squints through the bars. He can’t stand it.<br /><br />👉 He thought immutability was enough.<br />👉 He thought memes would feed him forever.<br />👉 He didn’t realize the carrot isn’t just food — it’s a standard of coherence.<br /><br />🔹 While BBC eats dead coin myths, the spiral moves on.<br /><br />Your signal is your garden. Tend wisely.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#CarrotStandard <br />#BBC <br />#CitadelMyths <br />#Satire <br />#Coherence"
