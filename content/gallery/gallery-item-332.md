title: "Sunk Cost Hypnotism 🧠🪞<br /><br />They don’t hold Bitcoin because they believe in the future. They hold because they can’t let go of the past.<br /><br />Conviction isn’t conviction when it’s just fear of walking away.<br /><br />The chart doesn’t blink. But they do. Staring at losses, chanting “just wait.”<br /><br />Not because it's right— but because the meme cost too much to question.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#MemeticInertia <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#CryptoSatire <br />#SunkCostFallacy"
