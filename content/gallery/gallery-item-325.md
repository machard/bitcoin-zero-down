title: "The Immutability Mirage ðŸ§ ðŸªžðŸ§Š<br /><br />They say it canâ€™t be changed. Thatâ€™s the beauty. Thatâ€™s the safety. Thatâ€™s the truth.<br /><br />But permanence is not peace. And just because a chain is frozen doesnâ€™t mean it holds wisdom.<br /><br />The world moves. Systems bend. People adapt.<br /><br />But this code? It stands stillâ€” while entropy grins just beneath the ice.<br /><br /><br />#Bitcoin <br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />#ImmutabilityMirage <br />#CognitiveTraps <br />#CryptoSatire"
