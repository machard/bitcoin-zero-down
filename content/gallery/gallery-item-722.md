title: "“PoS is working — so why are so many still stuck on PoW?”<br /><br />Because narratives have inertia.<br />Because Bitcoin came first, and people confuse first with best.<br />Because it feels safer to follow a 12-word slogan than to learn how a validator set works.<br /><br />But let’s be honest:<br />- The “decentralized energy security” pitch has become a shield for status quo extraction.<br />- The average person can do more, earn more, and build more in PoS ecosystems today — without begging for inclusion.<br />- This isn’t opinion. It’s observable. It’s live. It’s working.<br /><br />The facts have changed. The logic has changed.<br />It’s time for the story to catch up.<br /><br /><br />#ProofOfStake <br />#CryptoRealityCheck <br />#Ethereum <br />#Solana <br />#PoWvsPoS <br />#Web3Truths"
