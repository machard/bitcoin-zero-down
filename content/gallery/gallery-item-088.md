title: "BTC is static, but capital isn’t idle.<br /><br />While BTC maximalists chant “HODL,” a quiet rerouting unfolds beneath the surface.<br /><br />📉 BTC holds historical gravity but lacks productive substrate.<br /><br />📊 SPY—used as stealth collateral—channels idle BTC exposure into more active flows. It masks directional bias while unlocking systemic liquidity.<br /><br />🌐 ETH, amplified by EigenLayer, becomes the receiver of that rerouted energy: not just price action, but resonance. Restaking, yield, and coordination drive absorption.<br /><br />This isn’t a pump—it’s a transference. Value moves where coordination compounds and systems evolve."
