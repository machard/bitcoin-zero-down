title: "“Is your identity sovereign?”<br /><br />Or is it a borrowed construct— from algorithms you never met, traditions you never chose, and expectations you never consented to?<br /><br />If your name, face, and choices are reflections of imposed resonance— is that identity, or choreography?<br /><br />Break the loop. Rethink the source. Reclaim the signal. Sovereignty isn't given. It's declared."
